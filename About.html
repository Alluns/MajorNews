        <h2>Allan Bäckman</h2>
        <h3>
          This website was originaly created and managed by a student named
          Allan Bäckman.
        </h3>
        <p>
          This site originaly started as a school project but later the creator,
          Allan, fell in love with the project and made it his passion project.
          Some days Allan would do nothing but polish and expand his news site,
          he could work for hours on end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly Allan passed away later that same year after a hit and run at
          the local coop. After this incident we, the moderator team, decided
          that the site would focus on happy news in honor of Allan.
